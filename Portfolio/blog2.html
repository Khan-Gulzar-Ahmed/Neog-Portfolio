    This week, rumors of a big PlayStation 5 restock at various retailers—including Walmart, Best Buy, and Amazon—drove customers to stand in lines for hours just for a chance to get their hands on the gaming console, which Sony released last November.
    
    When new gaming consoles hit the market, they typically have stock issues for a few months, but in this case the pandemic and a major computer chip shortage have extended stock issues for almost a year.

    “You want the shortest distance between ‘add to cart’ and checkout,” he says.
    
    If you want a PS5 and haven’t had any luck, try signing up for alerts on Twitter. Online bots search an online store’s web code for a signal—such as an “add to cart” button—indicating that the PlayStation 5 is back in stock, according to New York Times tech writer Brian X. Chen.
