You don’t need to drop $2,000 for a laptop that can play most current games on high or ultra settings at 1080p—you can get those capabilities in a laptop that costs less than $1,200. But all cheap gaming laptops make some big trade-offs to pack that much power in at that price. After spending more than 30 hours researching and testing 14 budget gaming laptops, we found that the Asus TUF Gaming A15 (TUF506IU-ES74) is an excellent value if you’re willing to overlook some of its shortcomings
The Asus TUF Gaming A15 (TUF506IU-ES74) provides great gaming performance for the price. It also keeps its most-touched surfaces cool during long gaming sessions, and it comes with nice extras such as a comfortable RGB keyboard and a high-refresh-rate screen. It has decent battery life (for a gaming laptop), and it’s easy to upgrade if you want more storage. But its fans are loud during games, you have no way to manually run those fans at max speed for extra cooling when you need it, and some owners have encountered problems with the A15’s trackpad.
